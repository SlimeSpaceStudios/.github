# SlimeSpace Studios

Welcome to **SlimeSpace Studios**, a dedicated team of developers, modders, and gamers focused on creating unique mods and projects for Minecraft and beyond. Our projects range from server utilities to gameplay enhancements, all built with quality and community in mind.

## üåü Our Projects

### 1. **OreNotifier**
AntiXray is a mod that tracks every ore mined by players, sending notifications to a Discord webhook. It helps server admins monitor suspicious mining activity and ensures a fair gameplay experience. Key features include:
- Tracks each ore mined.
- Sends detailed embeds via Discord webhooks.
- Detects ore veins and sends vein details in a single message.
- Logs time between ores found.

### 2. **SlimeUpdater**
SlimeUpdater ensures that clients always have the latest mods installed to match the server. It automatically detects changes on server start and prompts users to restart Minecraft to apply updates.
